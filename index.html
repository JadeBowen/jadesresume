        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My journey into telecommunications began at the age of 12 when I visited my first cell phone site with my father, a seasoned telecommunications engineer, and witnessed the intricate workings of wireless communication. Watching communication flow effortlessly through the air ignited a passion in me. My father, who I've always looked up to as my hero, not only introduced me to this fascinating world but also taught me the importance of patience and precision—skills that have shaped my career. His words, "Take the time to get it right, because what we build connects people," have guided me ever since.</p>
        <p>With over 21 years of experience in construction and telecommunications, I've carried that lesson with me while overseeing large-scale projects and leading diverse teams. As a single father of four, I've mastered multitasking and time management, which have been invaluable in both my personal and professional life. My true passion lies in building systems that impact people and improve their lives—creating connections that bring the world closer together.</p>
