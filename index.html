    <h1>Jade Bowen</h1>
    <p>My journey into telecommunications began at the age of 12, when I visited my first cell phone site with
      my father, who is still an engineer for a well-known carrier today. Watching communication flow through
      the air like magic sparked something in me, and I’ll never forget the excitement of uploading that AOL
      disc and experiencing the internet for the first time. My father, who I’ve always looked up to as my
      hero, not only introduced me to this fascinating world but also taught me the importance of patience and
      precision—skills that have shaped my career. His words, “Take the time to get it right, because what we
      build connects people,” have guided me ever since.</p>

    <p>With over 21 years of experience in construction and telecommunications, I’ve carried that lesson with
      me while overseeing large-scale projects and leading diverse teams. As a single father of four, I’ve
      mastered multitasking and time management, which have been invaluable in both my personal and
      professional life. My true passion lies in building systems that impact people and improve their lives—
      just like my hero showed me, creating connections that bring the world closer together.</p>
